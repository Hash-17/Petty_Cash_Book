# Petty_Cash_Book
A petty cash book is maintained to record small expenses such as fees, rents, EMIs,
taxes. A separate column is used for each type of expenditure.

The difference between the sum of the debit items and the sum of the credit items
represents the balance of the petty cash in hand.

A petty cash book also refers to the book in which small payments are recorded,
which are not convenient to record in the main cash book.


A small-to-medium institute / business can manage their daily
income and expenses through this application.
